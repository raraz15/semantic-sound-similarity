# semantic-sound-similarity

This repository contains the code to run the experiments described in our [CBMI2024](https://cbmi2024.org/) paper, "Evaluation of Deep Audio Representations for Semantic Sound Similarity".

A copy of the paper is included in the `paper-poster-presentation/` directory

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raraz15/semantic-sound-similarity
    cd semantic-sound-similarity
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10.12 is required):

    ```bash
    python3.10 -m venv sss
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

     ```bash
     source sss/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

You're now ready to run the project!
